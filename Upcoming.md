    - Complete rewrite of the old system to no longer run our internal events on every inventory for credit purposes, this

    - This new system allows us to track when items are moved/removed in/from inventories such as vaults to help prevent
    duplicated inventories.
    - This also fixes a weird issue caused when using Essential's invsee command with TNE running
    - This new system will also allow me to implement my new inventory-based shop system correctly
