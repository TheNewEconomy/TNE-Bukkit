- Alpha 6.0 "Final Stages"
  - Rework shops to be more user-friendly. I want a shop system that isn't all command based such as the one we have now. More or less a more chest "friendly" version.

  - Inventory System
    - Complete rewrite of the old system to no longer run our internal events on every inventory for credit purposes, this
    was one of the few places still causing errors for server owners.
    - This new system allows us to track when items are moved/removed in/from inventories such as vaults to help prevent
    duplicated inventories.
    - This also fixes a weird issue caused when using Essential's invsee command with TNE running
    - This new system will also allow me to implement my new inventory-based shop system correctly
