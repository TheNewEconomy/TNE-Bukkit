About
--------------
The New Economy is a feature-packed modular economy plugin that is currently under development. TNE is meant to offer an all-in-one solution for server owners, while also providing an easy-to-use modular system, which allows
server owners to simply disable features they don't wish to use, or even remove the module's jar to save disk space. TNE's modular system also allows third-party developers to easily add additional features without
the need for additional dependencies. Developers, of course, are welcome to add functionality via TNE's custom events, API, Vault, or Reserve(Recommended).

API
---------
To acces the API import the jar file(TNE.jar) then use the following code:  

```java
TNE.instance().api();  
```

In the following example we'll get a player's balance using the API.  

```java
TNEAPI ecoAPI = TNE.instance().api();  
ecoAPI.getBalance(player);
```

Source code for the API class can be found [here](https://github.com/TheNewEconomy/TNE-Bukkit/blob/master/src/com/github/tnerevival/core/api/TNEAPI.java).
