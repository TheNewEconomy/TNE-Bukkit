Bug Reporting
==================

So you've found a bug? At this point you're probably raging, throwing your mouse around the room, and ultimately cursing
creatorfromhell's existance. Now I know that software bugs are relatively new(since around the 1980s), but have no fear!
There's this new thing in the world called a bug report. What is this "bug report" thing that you speak of? Well, it's
actually quite revolutionary. You see, all you do is click [here](https://github.com/TheNewEconomy/TNE-Bukkit/issues/new),
fill out and submit the form using the Bug Report Format from the [Report Format Page](Report Format.md), and it actually lets me know of the issue. How fascinating!
